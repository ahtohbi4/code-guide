#### Setting The Viewport

Include the following `<meta>` viewport element in all your web pages:

```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
```

A `<meta>` viewport element gives the browser instructions on how to control the page's dimensions and scaling.

The `width=device-width` part sets the width of the page to follow the screen-width of the device (which will vary depending on the device).

The `initial-scale=1.0` part sets the initial zoom level when the page is first loaded by the browser.
